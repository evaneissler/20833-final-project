"Letter to General Secretary Gorbachev
I noted in my recent discussions with you that, as a result of Chernobyl and other events since last year’s summit, the Soviets are becoming increasingly defensive and withdrawn.2 Much of this problem is of their own making, and you are under no obligation to make a special effort to bring them back to a more active negotiating posture. Nevertheless, the current Soviet mood undermines the prospects for significant progress in our own agenda. A prolonged deadlock in U.S.-Soviet relations also may increase the electoral difficulties facing such strong supporters of yours as Mrs. Thatcher and Helmut Kohl. An American act of statesmanship now could go a long way to helping us on both these scores in the months ahead.

As I mentioned to you last week, I think the time is right for a forward-looking personal letter to Gorbachev which notes your dissatisfaction with results since the summit, tells him the time for recrimination is over, picks up his suggestions for cooperation on nuclear reactor [Page 962]safety, reminds him of the ideas you gave Dobrynin in April,3 and urges him to get down to business. The letter also notes that, given Gorbachev’s stress on atmospherics, you will make a speech in the near future on U.S.-Soviet relations. A draft letter is attached.4 We will provide a draft speech text in the next few days.

In addition, I strongly recommend that you receive Armand Hammer and Dr. Robert Gale (the physician who treated many of the Chernobyl victims) on Thursday.5 Both met recently with Gorbachev and may be able to provide fresh insights on his current thinking. In addition, the meeting would provide an excellent opportunity to underscore your support for greater cooperation between the U.S. and Soviet peoples despite recent tensions in the relationship.6"
