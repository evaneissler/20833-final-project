"2. In a meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh, June 6, Ambassador Hartman conveyed the President’s initial response to Gorbachev’s June 1 oral statement on nuclear power plant safety3 (reftel). The Ambassador said that the President considered Gorbachev’s proposals on nuclear plant safety constructive and that the recent accident at Chernobyl had intensified public pressure on all governments to ensure that nuclear power was safe. He noted that we were the same day conveying a DOE offer to provide the Soviet Union with a database on possible health effects of nuclear accidents. We understood also that Dr. Gale was very interested in conducting a long-term study of the public health impact of the Chernobyl accident. All of these efforts would be important in generating scientific data rather than uninformed speculation. The Ambassador also noted that Ambassador Kennedy and Chairman Petrosyants would be meeting at the end of July to resume their discussion of nuclear non-proliferation. As a former member of the NRC, Ambassador Kennedy would be interested in a thorough exchange of views on a wide range of nuclear safety issues.

3. Bessmertnykh said that he was glad to hear that the U.S. would look carefully at the Soviet proposals. He added that the Soviet side had made a “good effort” to come up with positive proposals and looked forward to a detailed U.S. response. Bessmertnykh briefly took issue with the language in the President’s oral statement calling on the USSR to “join the U.S. in serious arms control negotiations.” He asserted that the Soviet Union had always taken a serious approach and wanted progress in arms control."
