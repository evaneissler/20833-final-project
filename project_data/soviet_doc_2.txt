# Mikhail Gorbachev's Address to the Soviet Nation on Chernobyl
## May 14, 1986 (Televised Speech)

Good evening, comrades.

As you know, a misfortune has befallen us -- the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It has painfully affected Soviet people and caused the anxiety of the international public. For the first time ever we encountered in reality such a sinister force as nuclear energy that has escaped control.

Considering the extraordinary and dangerous nature of what had happened in Chernobyl the Political Bureau (Politburo) took into its hands the entire organization of work to ensure the speediest liquidation of the breakdown and the limitation of its consequences.

A government commission was formed and immediately left for the scene of the accident while at the Political Bureau a group was formed under (Prime Minister) Nikolai Ivanovich Ryzhkov to solve urgent questions.

All work is being conducted actually on a round-the-clock basis. The scientific, technical and economic possibilities of the entire country have been put to use. Operating in the area of the accident are organizations of many union ministries and agencies under the leadership of ministers, prominent scientists and specialists, units of the Soviet army and the ministry of internal affairs.

A huge share of the work and responsibility has been taken upon themselves by the party, government and economic bodies of the Ukraine and Byelorussia. The operating staff of the Chernobyl nuclear power station are working selflessly and courageously.

So what did happen?

As specialists report, the reactor's capacity suddenly increased during a scheduled shutdown of the fourth unit. The considerable emission of steam and subsequent reaction resulted in the formation of hydrogen, its explosion, damage to the reactor and the associated radioactive release.

It is yet early to pass final judgment on the causes of the accident. All aspects of the problem -- design, projecting, technical and operational -- are under the close scrutiny of the government commission.

It goes without saying that when the investigation of the causes of the accident is completed, all the necessary conclusions will be drawn and measures will be taken ruling out a repetition of anything of the sort.

As I have said already, it is the first time that we encountered such an emergency when it was necessary quickly to curb the dangerous force of the atom that had escaped from under control and keep the scale of the accident to the minimum.

The seriousness of the situation was obvious. It was necessary to evaluate it urgently and competently. And as soon as we received reliable initial information it was made available to Soviet people and sent through diplomatic channels to the governments of foreign countries.

On the basis of this information practical work was launched to liquidate the accident and limit its grave aftermaths.

In the situation that had taken shape we considered it our top priority duty, a duty of special importance to ensure the safety of the population and provide effective assistance to those who had been affected by the accident.

The inhabitants of the settlement near the station were evacuated within a matter of hours and then, when it had become clear that there was a potential threat to the health of people in the adjoining zone, they also were moved to safe areas.

All this complex work required utmost speed, organization and precision.

Nevertheless the measures that were taken failed to protect many people. Two died at the time of the accident -- Vladimir Nikolayevichy Shashenok, an adjuster of automatic systems, and Valery Ivanovich Khodemchuk, an operator of the nuclear power plant. As of today 299 people were in hospital diagnosed as having radiation disease of varying degress of gravity. Seven of them have died. Every possible treatment is being given to the rest. The best scientific and medical specialists of the country, specialized clinics in Moscow and other cities are taking part in treating them and have at their disposal the most modern means of medicine.

On behalf of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) Central Committee and the Soviet government I express profound condolences to the families and relatives of the deceased, to the work collectives, to all who have suffered from this misfortune, who have suffered personal loss. The Soviet government will take care of the families of those who died and who suffered.

The inhabitants of the areas that heartily welcomed the evacuees deserve the highest appreciation. They responded to the misfortune of their neighbors as though it was their own, and in the best traditions of our people displayed consideration, responsiveness and attention.

The CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government are receiving thousands upon thousands of letters and telegrams from Soviet people and also from foreign citizens expressing sympathy and support for the victims. Many Soviet families are prepared to take children to their homes for the summer and are offering material help. There are numerous requests from people to be sent to work in the area of the accident.

These manifestations of humaneness, genuine humanism, of high moral standards cannot but move every one of us.

Assistance to people, I repeat, remains our top priority task.

At the same time vigorous work is under way at the station itself and the adjacent territory to limit the scale of the accident. In the most difficult conditions it proved possible to extinguish the fire and prevent it from spreading to the other power units.

The staff of the station stopped the three other reactors and switched them into a safe state. They are under constant control.

A stern test has been passed and is being passed by all -- firemen, transport and building workers, medics, special chemical protection units, helicopter crews and other detachments of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

In these difficult conditions much depended on a correct scientific evaluation of what was happening because without such an evaluation it would have been impossible to work out and apply effective measures of coping with the accident and its aftermaths. Our prominent scientists from the Academy of Sciences, leading specialists from the union ministries and agencies, the Ukraine and Byelorussia are successfully coping with this task.

I must say that people have acted and are continuing to act heroically, selflessly.

I think we will yet have an opportunity to name these courageous people and assess their exploits worthily.

I have every reason to say that despite the entire gravity of what happened the damage turned out to be limited owing to a decisive degree to the courage and skill of our people, their loyalty to duty, the concerted manner in which everybody taking part in liquidating the aftermaths of the accident are acting.

This task, comrades, is being solved not only in the area of the nuclear power station itself but also in the scientific institutes, at many enterprises of the country which are supplying everything that is necessary to those who are directly engaged in the difficult and dangerous struggle to cope with the accident.

Thanks to the effective measures taken, it is possible to say today that the worst has passed. The most serious consequences have been averted. Of course, the end is not yet. It is not time to rest. Extensive and long work still lies ahead. The level of radiation in the station's zone and on the territory in the immediate vicinity still remains dangerous for human health.

The top-priority task as of today, therefore, is operations to deal with the effects of the accident. A large-scale program for the deactivation of the territory of the electric power station and the settlement, of buildings and structures has been drawn up and is being implemented.

The necessary manpower, material and technical resources have been concentrated for that purpose. In order to prevent the radioactive contamination of the water basin measures are being taken at the site of the station and on the adjacent territory.

Organizations of the meteorological service are constantly monitoring the radiation situation on the ground surface, on water, and in the atmosphere. They have at their disposal the necessary technical systems and are using specially equipped planes, helicopters and ground monitoring stations.

It is absolutely clear all these operations will take much time and will require no small efforts. They should be carried out meticulously in a planned and organized manner. The area must be restored to the state that is absolutely safe for the health and normal life of the people.

I cannot but fail to mention one more aspect of that affair. I mean the reaction abroad to what happened at Chernobyl. In the world on the whole, and this should be emphasized, the misfortune that befell us and our actions in that complicated situation were treated with understanding.

We are profoundly grateful to our friends in socialist countries who have shown solidarity with the Soviet people at a difficult moment. We are grateful to the political and public figures in other states for their sincere sympathy and support.

We express our kind feelings to foreign scientists and specialists who showed readiness to come up with assistance in overcoming the consequences of the accident. I would like to note the participation of the American medics Robert Gale and Paul Terasaki in the treatment of the affected persons and to express gratitude to the business circles of those countries which promptly reacted to our request for the purchase of certain types of equipment, materials and medicines.

We evaluate in a fitting manner the objective attitude to the events at the Chernobyl nuclear power station on the part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its director-general Hans Blix.

In other words, we highly appreciate the sympathy of all those who treated our trouble and our problems with an open heart.

But it is impossible to leave without attention and political assessment the way the event at Chernobyl was met by the governments, political figures and the mass media in certain NATO countries, especially the U.S.A.

They launched an unrestrained anti-Soviet campaign. It is difficult to imagine what was said and written in these days -- 'thousands of casualties,' 'mass graves of the dead,' 'desolate Kiev,' that 'the entire land of the Ukraine has been poisoned,' and so and so forth.

Generally speaking, we faced a veritable mountain of lies -- most dishonest and malicious lies. It is unpleasant to recall all this, but it should be done. The international public should know what we had to face. This should be done to find the answer to the questions: what, in fact, was behind the highly immoral campaign?

Bluntly speaking, certain Western politicians were after very definite aims -- to blast the possibilities for balancing international relations, to sow new seeds of mistrust and suspicion toward the socialist countries.

All this made itself felt clearly during the meeting of the leaders of 'The Seven' held in Tokyo not so long ago. What did they tell the world, what dangers did they warn mankind of? Of Libya groundlessly accused of terrorism, and also of the Soviet Union which, it turns out, failed to provide them with 'full' information about the accident at Chernobyl.

And not a word about the most important thing -- how to stop the arms race, how to rid the world of the nuclear threat. Not a word in reply to the Soviet initiatives, to our specific proposals on the termination of nuclear tests, on ridding mankind of nuclear and chemical weapons, on reducing conventional arms.

How should all this be interpreted? One involuntarily gets the impression that the leaders of the capitalist powers who gathered in Tokyo wanted to use Chernobyl as a pretext for distracting the attention of the world public from all those problems that make them uncomfortable, but are so real and important for the world.

The accident at the Chernobyl station and the reaction to it have become a kind of a test of political morality. Once again two different approaches, two different lines of conduct were revealed for everyone to see.

The ruling circles of the U.S.A. and their most zealous allies -- I would like to especially mention the F.R.G. (West Germany) among them - regarded the mishap only as another possibility to put up additional obstacles holding back the development and deepening of the current East-West dialogue, progressing slowly as it is, and to justify the nuclear arms race.

What is more, an attempt has been made to prove to the world that talks, moreover, agreements with the USSR are impossible, and thus to give a green light to further military preparations.

Our attitude to this tragedy is absolutely different. We realize that it is another sound of the Tocsin, another grim warning that the nuclear era necessitates a new political thinking and a new policy.

This has strengthened still more our conviction that the foreign policy course worked out by the 27th Communist Party Congress is correct that that our proposals for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the ending of nuclear explosions, the creation of an all-embracing system of international security meet those inexorably stringent demands which the nuclear age makes on the political leadership of all countries.

As to the 'lack' of information, around which a special campaign has been launched, and of political content and nature at that, this matter in the given case is an invented one. The following facts confirm that this, indeed, is so. Everybody remembers that it took the U.S. authorities 10 days to inform their own Congress and months to inform the world community about the tragedy that took place at Three Mile Island atomic power station in 1979.

I have already said how we acted.

All this enables one to judge who and how approaches the matter of informing one's own people and foreign countries.

But the essence of the matter is different. We hold that the accident at Chernobyl, just as the accidents at the U.S., British and other atomic power stations, poses to all states very serious problems, which require a responsible attitude.

Over 370 atomic reactors now function in different countries. This is reality. The future of the world economy can hardly be imagined without the development of atomic power. Altogether 40 reactors with an aggregate capacity of over 28 million kilowatts now operate in our country. As is known, mankind derives a considerable benefit from atoms for peace.

But it stands to reason that we are all obliged to act with still greater caution, to concentrate the forces of science and technology to ensure the safe harnessing of the great and formidable powers contained in the atomic nucleus.

The indisputable lesson of Chernobyl to us is that in conditions of the further development of the scientific and technical revolution the questions of reliability and safety of equipment, the questions of discipline, order and organization assume priority importance. The most stringent demands everywhere and in everything are needed.

Further, we deem it necessary to declare for a serious deepening of cooperation in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. What steps could be considered in this connection?

First, creating an international regime of safe development of nuclear power on the basis of close cooperation of all nations dealing with nuclear power engineering. A system of prompt warning and supply of information in the event of accidents and faults at nuclear power stations, specifically when this is accompanied by the escape of radioactivity, should be established in the framework of this regime.

Likewise it is necessary to adjust an international mechanism, both on a bilateral and multilateral basis, for the speediest rendering of mutual assistance when dangerous situations emerge.

Second, for the discussion of the entire range of matters it would be justifiable to convene a highly authoritative specialized international conference in Vienna under IAEA auspices.

Third, in view of the fact that IAEA was founded back in 1957 and that its resources and staff are not in keeping with the level of the development of present day nuclear power engineering, it would be expedient to enhance the role and possibilities of that unique international organization. The Soviet Union is ready for this.

Fourth, it is our conviction that the United Nations and its specialized institutions, such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations Environmental Program, should be involved more actively in the effort to ensure safe development of peaceful nuclear activity.

For all this, it should not be forgotten that in our world where everything is interrelated there exist, alongside problems of atoms for peace, also problems of atoms for war. This is the main thing now. The accident at Chernobyl showed again what an abyss will open if nuclear war befalls mankind. For inherent in the nuclear arsenals stockpiled are thousands upon thousands of disasters far more horrible than the Chernobyl one.

In conditions when the attention to nuclear matters increased, the Soviet government, having considered all circumstances connected with the security of its people and entire humanity, has decided to extend its unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests till Aug. 6 this year. This is the date on which more than 40 years ago the first atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, as a result of which hundreds of thousands of people perished.

We urge the United States again to consider with utmost responsibility the measure of danger looming over mankind, to heed the opinion of the world community. Let those who are at the head of the United States show by deeds their concern for the life and health of people.

I confirm my proposal to President Reagan to meet without delay in the capital of any European state that will be prepared to accept us or, say, in Hiroshima, and to agree on a ban on nuclear testing.

The nuclear age forcefully demands a new approach to international relations, the pooling of efforts of states with different social systems for the sake of putting an end to the disastrous arms race and of a radical improvement of the world political climate. Broad horizons will then be cleared for fruitful cooperation of all countries and peoples, and all men on earth will gain from that.
