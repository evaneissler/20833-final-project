Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet UnionComrade V. I. Dolgikh I am reporting on the results of the work of troops to liquidate the consequences of the accidentat the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in November of this year1.The radiological situation in the area of the Nuclear Power Station (NPS) is improving. Levels of radiation amount to: at a height of 200 m above the reactor – less than 4 Roentgen per hour (in May of this year it was more than 200); in close proximity to the reactor 100-400; at the perimeter station – from 0.003 to 1.1 in the beginning and 0.003-0.56 Roentgen per hour at the end of the month. On a daily basis, helicopters and up to 80 ground chemical reconnaissance patrols were involved in monitoring the radiation situation. 2.Work on the NPS site was carried out in three shifts and involved up to 6000 people.On the 10th of November, decontamination of the main housing and the auxiliary spaces of the third energy block was completed. Levels of radiation decreased from 200-1300 to 30-250 milliroentgen per hour. In order to maintain the resulting level of radioactive pollution until the end of the month they treated 194.4 thousand sq/m of surfaces; altogether, taking into account repeated decontamination, 1,782,000 square meters were treated. In the inner rooms of energy block 1 and 2, in order to maintain permitted levels of radioactive pollution, treatment is being carried out as needed. 397.5 thousand square meters of area have been deactivated, with a total since the beginning of the work of 1 million 604 thousand square meters. Levels of radiation from the machine room in the first energy block amount to 1.1 to 1.5 milliroentgen per hour and in the second 8-11 milliroentgen per hour. Work was carried out on decontamination of the NPS site, the treatment facilities and the open distribution units. They laid 1.5 thousand square meters of concrete sheet and 15.5 thousand square meters were covered with asphalt.  Totals from the beginning of the effort are 350.8 and 32.3 thousand square meters respectively. They removed contaminated soil from an area of 315 thousand square meters, for a total of 709.1 thousand since the beginning of the work.The special manufacturing shop of the construction plant had been treated.  Per month they deactivated 18.4 thousand square meters of inner rooms (altogether from the start, a total of 44.1 thousand square meters) and 19.2 thousand square kilometers of territory (from the start a total of 44.4 thousand square meters). 
They began work on the decontamination of the building site and of the facilities of the third stage. They processed 467.7 thousand square meters of outer and inner surfaces, and also 430.1 thousand square meters of territory. The levels of radiation of the facilities decreased from 25-30 to 10-11 milliroentgen per hour and the levels of the territory from 30-50 to 12-20 milliroentgen per hour.3.Work in the city of Pripyat and the city of ChernobylIn the city of Pripyat the decontamination work in the residential area has been completed. 316 buildings were treated,with a total area of 522.5 thousand square meters. They removed contaminated soil in an area of 1160.7 thousand square meters. Levels of radiation are reduced from 15-34 milliroentgen to 2-4 milliroentgen per hour. Treatment facilities were decontaminated (68 thousand square meters) and work started on the decontamination zone adjacent to the residential area in Pripyat (445.4 thousand sq. meters were processed from the 635 thousand sq. meters scheduled under the plan).In the city of Chernobyl the planned decontamination work has been completed on 36 buildings and their surrounding areas. 294.7 thousand sq. meters of building surfaces have been treated, as well as roads and sidewalks, and contaminated soil was removed from an area of 425.1 thousand sq. meters. Levels of radiation are reduced from 1.5-2 down to 0.1-0.5 milliroentgen per hour.The laying down of 6.7 km of heating pipes has been completed. 4.Work in other populated areas.Decontamination work in November was conducted in 54 populated areas in the Kiev, Zhytomyr and south Gomel oblasts. Since the 15th of May 350 populated areas have been treated.
