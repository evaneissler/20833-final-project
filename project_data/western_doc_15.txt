POWER REACTOR IS REPORTED TO BE ARCUND 100 PEOPLE: A
NIGHT SHIFT WOULD BE 25-35 PEOPLE. THIS WOULD MEAN THAT
BECAUSE UNIT 3 AND 4 ARE ADJACENT, AS MANY AS 200 PEOPLE
IN THE DAYTIME OR 50-70 PEOPLE AT NIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN
WORKING IN THE VICINITY OF REACTOR LNIT 4 WHEN THE
ACCIDENT BEGAN. WHILE WE WOULD EXPECT THAT AN IMMEDIATE
EVACUATION WAS ORDERED WHEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE
ACCIDENT BECAME APPARENT, STILL A FAIRLY LARGE CREW
(COMPARED TO US REACTOR OPERATIONS) WOULD BE EXPECTED TO
REMAIN TO CARRY OUT EMERGENCY PROCECURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
SHUT DOWN THE REACTOR AND TO SOLVE WHATEVER PROBLEM MAY
HAVE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT. THIS CREW WOULD BE A "FORLORN
НОРЕ," KЕPТ AТ THE SITE IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM,
BUT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WOLLD BE LOST SHOULD THE
PROBLEM WORSEN DRAMATICALLY. THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO
THIS WOULD BE TO ABANDON THE SITE INMEDIATELY AT THE SIGN
OF MAJOR PROBLEMS, WHICH WOULD VIRTUALLY INSURE THE SORT
OF DISASTER THAT ULTIMATELY OCCURED.
3. IF THE ACCIDENT SITUATION LASTEC FOR ANY AMOUNT OF
TIME WE WOULD EXPECT THE EMERGENCY CREW TO BE AUGMENTED
AS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION BECAME KNOWN. SHIFT
SUPERVISORS AND FOREMEN FROM THE OTHER UNITS WOULD BЕ
CALLED IN TO MAKE SURE THAT APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WERE
BEING TAKEN TO HEAD OFF ANY POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE.
IMAGERY SHOWING FIRE ENGINES AND EMERGENCY VEHICLES NEAR
THE REACTORS SUPPORTS THE SUPPOSITION THAT ADDITIONAL
PERSONNEL WERE RESPONDING TO THE ACCIDENT. THEY COULD
ONLY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BEFORE ANY EXPLOSION. BASED ON
NUMBERS OF VEHICLES IN THE AREA AND POSTULATING AN
AUGMENTED EMERGENCY CREW, AS MUCH AS 100 PEOPLE COULD
HAVE BEEN IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE REACTOR WHEN
MAJOR STEAM/GAS EXPLOSION OCCURRED, RIPPING OPEN THE
REACIOR BUILDING AND CAUSING MAJOR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.
4. BЕCAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF THE DANAGE OBSERVED ON
IMAGERY OF THE SITE, WE FEEL THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE
IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE UNIT 4 EXPLOSION WERE EITHER
KILLED OR SUFFERED LETHAL RADIATION DOSES AT THE TIME OF
THE EXPLOSION' THE FAILURE OF THE SOVIETS TO EVACUATE
THE FIRE ENGINES FROM THE LETHAL RACIATION ZONE AROUND
